Task 7: Identifying and Removing Suspicious Browser Extensions


What I did was to read the World Resources Report of 1989.

In this task, I opened both my Microsoft Edge browser and Firefox browser to ensure that I did not install any of the risky or unwanted extensions. Here is the way I did it:

On Edge

  launched Edge and hit the three dots (...) in the upper right corner, and then clicked Extensions.

  Clicked Manage Extensions to get all that is installed.

   And tested both extensions. I had such as:

   Writing help (Grammarly)

   Honey ( coupon finder )

  Adblock Plus

  One of the classic screen recording extensions which I haven t used in years.

  Opened Details on both of them and looked at their permissions. An old screen recorder could have this ability of reading and changing all your data on websites which I cannot even contemplate doing to a very rare feature of mine.

  Eliminated it by clicking on Remove.




  On Firefox

  On Firefox, I pressed the three lines ( 3 lines), Add-ons and Themes.

  Runned down the list under Extensions.

  Found:
   uBlock origin (ad blocker)
   LastPass (bahcc management software)
  An extension I did not recall using, a color picker.
  Looked at its details and noticed that it was quite a long time since it was last updated and was having a few dubious reviews.
 I chose to remove it in order to maintain a clean browser.




  Extensions I removed
Browser	           Extension                 Removed	Reason
Edge	        Screen Recorder Tool	    Not using it + too many permissions
Firefox	     Color Picker Extension	      Rarely used + outdated reviews



What I learned

  Even small extensions can have a lot of access to your data.

  Some outdated or poorly reviewed extensions could be security risks.

  By cleaning up, browsers can also start a little faster and use less memory.
